TASK 1:

Label images

Create script that changes format to AI city format

Create a function that reads the bbox from AI format

Add noise to change size and position of bounding boxes

Add probability to generate/delete bounding boxes

Functions to obtain metrics:

. IoU --> https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/11/07/intersection-over-union-iou-for-object-detection/
. MaP --> https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP

TASK 2:

. Show metrics against frame number. 

. Compare both metrics (IoU and MaP) to see which is more reliable in which cases.

. Vary noise and number of invented bboxes, show how metrics increase / decrease depending on the added noise.

TASK 3:

. Download KITTI dataset.

. Optical flow estimations using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm --> OPENCV!! --> https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_lucas_kanade.html

. Verify quality of our results (MSEN, PEPN)

TASK 4:

. Visualization + analysis of the results: histograms + optical flow visualization.
